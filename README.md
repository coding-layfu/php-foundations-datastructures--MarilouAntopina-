# PHP Digital Library Organizer

This is a mini PHP system that simulates a Digital Library Organizer that demonstrates Recursion for heirachical data, Hadh Tables for book metadata, and Binary Search Tree for efficient searching and alphabetical listing.

# The Purpose of this project 
 - To apply recursion to display hierarchical book categories.
 - To use associative arrays in order to store and also to retrieve book metadata.
 - To implement a Binary Search Tree in order to efficiently organize and search book titles.
 - To einforce algorithmic and logical problem-solving through PHP.

# How To Run Each Part
 1. Setup XAMPP
 2. Save all the project files inside One folder (C:\xampp\htdocs\libraryy\)
 3. Run in your browser (type http://localhost/libraryy/main.php)
